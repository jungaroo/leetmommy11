<h3>Agenda</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Overview of cryptography</li>
<li>Public key encryption</li>
<li>Digital signatures</li>
<li>HTTPS</li>
</ul>
<p>This aims to be a gentle introduction to cryptography, starting
with some classic symmetric encryption schemes, followed by
an introduction to modern symmetric schemes, and an introduction
to asymmetric cryptography. It covers how public-key encryption is
build using asymmetric cryptography, and provides a light introduction
to how this is used in things like HTTPS and OAuth v1.</p>
<p>While the <em>details</em> of cryptographic algorithms often involve difficult
math, very few software developers learn about (or need to know about)
these parts; this is generally specialized knowledge for cryptographers.
Instead, most developers learn about âprotocolsâ, the way that
the algorithms are used to solve real-world problems, like
sending secret messages, signing messages, generating digital cash,
providing anonymous-but-verifiable voting, and so on.</p>

<ul class="last simple">

want to send messages, vote, exchange cash, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Eve</strong>, who is evil and tries to steal messages.</li>
<li><strong>Mallory</strong>, who is malicious, and may disrupt messages, even if
he isnât trying to steal secrets. Mallory often plays a role known
as the âman in the middleâ.</li>
<li><strong>Trent</strong>, who is a trusted authority and often provides neutral
information, like timestamps.</li>

<p>This is one of the earlier ciphers known to have been used, by
Julius Caesar, for military messages.</p>
<p>Shift each letter by 3, Z wrapping back to A.</p>

<p>An important feature of cryptography is the âkey lengthâ â
how many different keys might you have to try to guess the key
by brute force. With only 25 possibilities, this has very
short key length â and so itâs entirely feasible to break it
by just trying every key.</p>

<p>While itâs impractical to solve this by trying all the combinations,
these can be easily solved with âfrequency analysisâ, by looking at
which ciphertext letters are most common, and matching those to the most common letters
in the plaintext language. Also, you can look for common words, bigraphs, trigraphs, etc.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how many cryptographic algorithms may be much easier to
break than their key length suggests: we have a huge key length here, but can typically
solve these very easily without trying anywhere number every possible key.</p>

<p>Called <em>le chiffre indÃ©chiffrable</em> â but, before 20th
century, easily broken.</p>
</div>
<p>This cipher has lots of fun history behind it. It was originally
described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553 but was mis-attributed
to Blaise de VigenÃ¨re in 1586 (he was actually writing about a much
better cipher, though harder to implement).</p>
<p>As late as 1917, it was considered impossible to break by many, but
Charles Babbage (one of the inventors of the computer and mentor to
Ada Lovelace) found a solution in the 1850s. His solution was
censored by the British government, though, as they were currently
using his process of how to break the cipher to decipher messages
in the Crimean War, and didnât want the fact known. This tension of
âWhat is known about cryptography publicly versus what is known inside
of military/intelligence communities is a common story).</p>
<p>It was still heavily used by the Confederate
Army, but the Union secretly routinely deciphered their messages.</p>
<p>A good, Python-oriented overview of the cipher is at
<a class="reference external" href="https://inventwithpython.com/hacking/chapter19.html">https://inventwithpython.com/hacking/chapter19.html</a>.</p>
<p>To decrypt a message, you can perform frequency analysis of it,
but this depends on knowing the key length. A clever method called
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination">Kasiski Examination</a>
can be used to determine that.</p>
<p>Thereâs a Python-based

<h3>Digital Algorithms</h3>
<p>Modern digital algorithms are similar in idea, but rely on complex
math transformations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Encrypt bits, not letters</li>
<li>Use more complex math transformations<ul>
<li>But principles are the same as classic cryptography</li>
<li>Key length typically expresed in bits<ul>
<li>20-bit key length means 2<sup>20</sup> possible keys</li>
<li>Each new bit makes brute force attack twice as hard</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Important digital encryption algorithms:</p>
<div class="docutils container">

<p>One time pads are great, but they cannot be re-used â if you encipher

<h3>Random Numbers</h3>

hundreds of volunteers worked throughout the war with bingo cage tumblers,
generated one random number after another and recording them on sheets,

<p>Even with these tiny numbers, it takes a modern computer over 1,000 times
as long to find those prime numbers from 36,853 as it takes to multiply them
to produce that number. In real life, the prime numbers used are typically
dozens of digits long, and the difference in speed is in the quadrillions
or more â making it very, very impractical to calculate, even with
significant computing resources and lots of time.</p>

<p>Python has a built-in hash function, <cite>hash</cite>, but this is not cryptographically
secure and should not be used for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Pythonâs hash is not cryptographically secure because itâs not sufficiently difficult
to predict another input phrase that would lead to the same hash; a
cryptographically secure hash algorithm makes that very, very difficult to do.</p>
<p>(For those whoâd like more detail: Pythonâs built-in hash is designed for use with
hash tables, the underlying data structure Python uses to built dictionaries. Itâs
important that this hash be super-fast. It also isnât âstableâ â the hash value
it creates can be different on different computers. This makes it great for hash
tables but not good for general-purpose or cryptographic hashes).</p>

<div class="section" id="hashes-for-signatures">
<h3>Hashes for Signatures</h3>
<div class="docutils container">
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remember, âsigningâ sends both plaintext + signature<ul>
<li>You authenticate signature by making sure they match</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That means sending a message at least 2x as plaintext<ul>
<li>And public-key encryption is slow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead:<ul>
<li>Make hash of message</li>
<li>Digitally sign hash</li>
<li>Send original message + signed hash</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example, letâs say we had a hash algorithm of âtake every 3rd letterâ
(this is a terrible algorithm, but easy to understand for our example).</p>
<p>Our message of <span class="blue">WHISKEYISSAFE</span> would hash into <cite>WSYSE</cite>. This
would be encrypted with the private key â becoming, say, <span class="red">GHOEQ</span>.
Both the real message and the signature are sent together:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
<span class="blue">WHISKEYISSAFE</span>/<span class="red">GHOEQ</span>
</pre>
<p>The recipient peels the two apart, hashes the original message, and decrypts
the signature. They then compare the decrypted signature to the hash, and if
they match, can trust that only the real sender could have produced that
signature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="signal-analysis">
<h3>Signal Analysis</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sometimes, you learn things not from breaking a code, but from:<ul>
<li>How a message is sent</li>
<li>When a message is sent</li>
<li>By whom a message is sent</li>
<li>How long a message is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called âsignal analysisâ</p>
<p>For example, you intercept this one-time pad message:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
<span class="blue">?? unknown text ??</span> +
<span class="orange">?? unknown key  ??</span> â
<span class="red">GJTXHJRAYRWSV</span>
</pre>
<div class="docutils container">
<p>You could still tell itâs</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
<span class="blue">WHISKEYISSAFE</span>
</pre>
<p>and not</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
<span class="blue">WHISKEYISASSASSINATED</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>To combat signal analysis, various strategies can be used:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fake messages can be sent to help hide real messages in a sea of fakes</li>
<li>messages are padded with extra, junk words, to hide the real length</li>
<li>messages are often proxied through several carriers, to make it harder
to connect the recipient and the sender from listening in</li>

<div class="admonition note">
<p><strong>SSL</strong></p>
<p>Different security layers have been used to provide HTTPS;
originally, a scheme called âSSLâ (secure sockets layer) was
used. This was found to have vulnerabilities, so newer versions
were introduced; these also had vulnerabilities. This was switched
to TLS in most browsers around 2001 â but many people and books
still talk about âSSLâ to mean âthe security layers used in HTTPSâ,
even though the ones actually used now are TLS.</p>
<p class="last">You can learn about <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Security">TLS</a>

<p>That HTTPS server doesnât need to know anything specific about Flask, nor
be written in Python. It just handles the HTTPS and then makes its own
HTTP request to Flask. (This does mean that youâd have to trust the
network between the HTTPS server and Flask, if theyâre not on the same
server). Common HTTPS servers include Apache, NGINX, and others. Sometimes,
external vendors can do the HTTPS work â like in Amazon Web Services or
using providers like CloudFlare.</p>
<p>It is possible to have Flask do HTTPS itself â but itâs usually preferred
to have an external server (this is helpful for other reasons, like fast
serving of static files, and solving the harder problems of mismatched
network speeds).</p>
